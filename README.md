# Basic Shooty Game in Lua/LOVE2D
An enemy bounces against some walls, and the player must shoot it. Every time the player hits the target, the target moves faster. If the player ever misses, its game over!

Requires LOVE2D to run (if I don't convert this to an .exe)

Uses a Lua library (Classic) to add classes/objects
